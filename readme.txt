This archive contains the addons and cfg folders of Mr. X.'s Teamplay Academy Empires server.

This archive will provide your Empires with:
	- Sourcemod: Administrative tools for source games with plugins such as kick, ban, mapvotes, nominate, rtv...
	- Fixed sourcemod offsets: Empires require special offsets for Sourcemod's commands such as slay to work.
	- Fixed sourcemod percentage results of votes: Empires has a compatibility issue with sourcemod's voting messages.
	- Integration for many of Empires server variables in the sourcemod admin menu.
	- Chat trigger commands for your admins and your players such as !unstuck or !recwalls (see: commandlist.txt)
	- NCEV: No Commander Extends Vote, a plugin by Neoony which extends the commander vote if teams have no commanders.
	- Chat advertisements for the chat trigger commands.
	- UMC3: Ultimate Mapchooser 3, an improvement over the base sourcemod mapchooser which allows for more control over the mapvotes, made compatible for Empires by Cyberkiller.
	- Showdamage: a plugin which shows damage done to the enemy.
	- Killerinfo: a Plugin which shows who killed you.
	- end-of-round-alltalk: a plugin to turn on alltalk at the end of the map, made compatible for Empires by the community.
	- Ungrief: a plugin that teleports the Command Vehicle.
	- Teamswitch: a plugin to teamswitch players.
	- sm_goto: a plugin to teleport players.
	- Admin Manager: a plugin to manage your admins in-game, no more need to find their IDs manually.
	- umc_mapcycle: a mapcycle that defines what maps can appear in the votes, each map having a set minimum and maximum amount of players limits. The 8 last players maps are also banned from the vote.
	- And more...
